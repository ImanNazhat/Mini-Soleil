"about.description" => "I’m Rogueya Tahir, an artist and creative director with a deep passion for both art and fashion.<br/>
 My journey started as a visual artist, showcasing my work in six exhibitions across different cities in France, always exploring new ways to express my creative vision.<br/>

Over time, I was drawn into the fashion world, studying fashion design and gaining hands-on experience—from working behind the scenes at Paris Fashion Week to collaborating with designers and photographers, and even stepping in front of the camera as a model.<br/>
 Each experience shaped my understanding of visual storytelling and how to bring ideas to life.<br/>

This led me to create Mini Soleil Agency, a creative direction agency dedicated to helping brands craft visual content that reflects their identity in a professional and modern way.",
